# FREE-Net: A Dual-Modality Emotion Recognition Network for Fusing Raw and Enhanced Data

FREE-Net is a novel architecture designed for dual-modality emotion recognition by integrating raw and enhanced data streams from speech and text modalities. 
It comprises two key components: the Raw Modality Emotion Module (RMEM), which processes unaltered, low-level input features, and the Enhanced Modality Emotion Module (EMEM), which extracts higher-level, contextually enriched representations. 
By combining these two perspectives, FREE-Net effectively addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity, offering a robust and holistic approach to emotion recognition. Its design is particularly suited for applications requiring fine-grained emotional analysis, such as human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and affective computing.
